# Bash and Zsh: between sh and shit

## USING A COMMON ALIAS FILE FOR BOTH SHELLS
---
The struggle is real

<br>

From what I can gather, the best strategy is to create a common file
and source that file in both `/etc/zsh/zprofile` and `/etc/profile/`.
The idea is that the common file would contain the aliases, or whatever
else needs to be shared between the two shells, and would normally have
the same effect if put into .bashrc or .zshrc.

`/etc/commonprofile`

```
source_sh () {
    emulate -LR sh
    . "$@"
}
```
