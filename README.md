# Dotfiles

Just one man's configuration files for his computer. Feel free to steal anything you think might be useful to you. I keep this here for multiple other perfectly good reasons that have nothing to do with anyone ever looking at them (not the least of which is so that they are backed up somewhere, but also so that if I break something I can rewind to a previous commit and un-break it), 
but I couldn't think of any reason not to make them public, so have at them whoever you are. There's nothing in here I care about people having, but if for some reason I am stupid enough to have left my bank account number or my social security info somewhere in one of these files, frankly I deserve whatever theft happens to me as a result.

You never know, maybe I've hidden credit card numbers deep within each file in some kind of code, like a high-stakes scavenger hunt. Then again, maybe these are just text files that contain a bunch of settings and preferences for a bunch of nerdy Linux software. It's one or the other...  or maybe it's BOTH! WHOOOOAH!



## Table of Configurations
---

Application | Config File | Description
--- | --- | --- 
Zsh | .zshrc | Primary config file for Zsh, which I use instead of bash as my default shell.
Oh-My-Zsh | .oh-my-zsh | Plugin manager for Zsh. Adds functionality and additional theme options through plugins which are retrieved from github by adding the repository names to the .zshrc file using a specific format.
NeoVim | .config/nvim | Ridiculously customizable and extensible text editor, functions as a complete IDE and works from within the terminal
Kitty | .config/kitty | Terminal emulator, one which I've come to like a lot. All settings are managed from the config file, there is no GUI to change anything, which is much cleaner and less hassle once you've got your config file the way you want it since there's no need to mess with settings ever again.
SDL2 | gamecontrollerdb.txt | A config file with settings for every controller I've ever heard of, configured for SDL2, control software that runs game peripherals and settings.
Tmux | .tmux.conf | A terminal multiplexer, which I have set to run as the first command after zsh on my terminal emulator. Tmux is awesome, you can quickly and easily split a terminal window into multiple terminals and then switch between them using custom key commands. Beats the hell out of having to mess with a new window every time you need another terminal.
